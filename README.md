# CS221-Final-Project

# Project Title

Collection of dataset and three classifiers - linear classifier, k-means classifier, neural net - which classify Lending Club loans into Lending Club risk grades.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Files in Repository

* **sgd.py** - code for linear classifier with SGD.
* **kmeans.py** - code to run k-means classifier.
* **neuralnet.py** - code for neural net classifier.
* **LoanStats3a.csv** - Lending Club dataset containing loan profiles and risk grade lables for 42,538 loans approved by Lending Club between 2007 and 2011.
* **smalldatasettest.csv** - Small portion of the above dataset, for early-stage testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Our classifiers rely on the following Python packages. All can be installed via the pip package manager.
* PyTorch
* NumPy
* SKLearn
* Pandas
* MatplotLib

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the classifiers
